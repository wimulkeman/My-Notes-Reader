My notes reader
===============

As I traverse through articles, course materials and other knowledge enhancing sources, I will update these notes in a effort not to loose some important though or insights.

This reader enables me to read those notes stored in Markdown files back.

## My Notes

The notes that needs to be read, can be stored in the resources directory. The file structure created within that map, and the Markdown files, will be shown on the index page.
